Similar to the QueensBoard algorithm, this algorithm will employ backtracking.
A knight, given that there is enough space, has 8 possible moves. 
The first knight will be placed on the top left corner of the board. It will perform one of its possible moves (there are only 2 at this point). 
The knight will continue moving until it finds that it has touched every square once OR cannot move again without touching a square it already touched. 
At this point, it will go back one move, and try another move. If there isn't another move to try, it will go back one move again. 

To keep track whether the knight has touched a square or not, we will mark the squares: 0 for available, -1 for visited.
