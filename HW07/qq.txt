I haven't figured out a way to find whether a n-queens and nxn board problem is solvable. However, by trial and error, I have found that there is at least 1 solution for the 4x4 to 8x8 problems. 

A	2 x 2 has no solutions.
B	3x3 has no solutions.
C	4x4 has 1 solution only.
D	5x5 has 2+ solutions.
E	6x6 has 1+ solutions.
F	7x7 has 1+ solutions.
G	8x8 has 1+ solutions.
